<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PH Probes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Refillable</li><li>Refillable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PH Probes are divided into two main market types based on their design- Non-Refillable and Refillable probes. Non-Refillable probes have a fixed electrolyte solution inside the probe, which cannot be replenished. These probes are cost-effective and require less maintenance. On the other hand, Refillable probes allow users to replace the electrolyte solution when needed, offering more accurate and consistent readings. While these probes are more expensive, they provide greater flexibility and long-term reliability in pH measurement applications.</p></p>
