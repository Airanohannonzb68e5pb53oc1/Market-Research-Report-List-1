<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Plasterboards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tapered-Edged</li><li>Square-Edged</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal plasterboards are available in two main types based on the edges - tapered-edged and square-edged. Tapered-edged plasterboards are designed with tapered edges on the long sides, allowing for easy jointing and creating a seamless finish when plastered. Square-edged plasterboards, on the other hand, have square edges which are ideal for use in areas where the edges will be covered with decorative moldings. Both types of plasterboards offer thermal insulation properties, making them suitable for use in buildings to improve energy efficiency.</p></p>
