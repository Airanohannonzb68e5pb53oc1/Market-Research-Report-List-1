<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-Wheeler Catalytic Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)</li><li>Lean NOx Catalysts (LNC)</li><li>Lean NOx Trap (LNT)</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology involves the use of a reducing agent, such as urea, to convert NOx emissions into nitrogen and water vapor. Lean NOx Catalysts (LNC) utilize a catalyst to reduce NOx emissions under lean (oxygen-rich) conditions. Lean NOx Trap (LNT) systems trap and store NOx emissions during lean operation, releasing them during rich (oxygen-poor) conditions for conversion. Other technologies in the Two-Wheeler Catalytic Converter market include diesel oxidation catalysts, three-way catalysts, and particulate filters. Each technology aims to reduce harmful emissions from two-wheeler vehicles.</p></p>
