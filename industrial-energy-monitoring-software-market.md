<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Energy Monitoring Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud Based</li><li>Premise Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial energy monitoring software can be categorized into two main types based on where the software is hosted: cloud-based and premise-based. Cloud-based software is hosted on external servers and accessed through a web browser, providing flexibility and scalability for users. Premise-based software, on the other hand, is installed on the user's local servers and maintained on-site. Both types of software offer monitoring and analysis of energy consumption in industrial settings, but the choice between cloud-based and premise-based solutions depends on factors such as data security and system integration requirements.</p></p>
