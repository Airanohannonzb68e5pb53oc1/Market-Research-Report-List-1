<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spray Polyurethane Foam Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Cell</li><li>Closed-Cell</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spray Polyurethane Foam (SPF) is available in two main types: Open-Cell and Closed-Cell. Open-Cell SPF is characterized by its softer, more flexible structure, allowing for moisture vapor to pass through. It is commonly used for interior applications where a lower R-value is sufficient. Closed-Cell SPF, on the other hand, has a more rigid structure and higher R-value, making it ideal for exterior applications where a stronger barrier against moisture and air infiltration is needed. Both types offer excellent thermal insulation properties and can help improve energy efficiency in buildings.</p></p>
