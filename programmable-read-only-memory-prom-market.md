<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Programmable Read only Memory PROM Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OTPROM</li><li>EPROM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Programmable Read-only Memory (PROM) is a type of non-volatile memory that can be programmed only once. There are two main types of PROMs - One-Time Programmable PROM (OTPROM) and Erasable Programmable Read-only Memory (EPROM). OTPROM can only be programmed once and cannot be erased. EPROM can be reprogrammed multiple times by exposing the memory to ultraviolet light to erase the previous data. Both types of PROM are widely used in various electronic devices for storing firmware and other essential information.</p></p>
