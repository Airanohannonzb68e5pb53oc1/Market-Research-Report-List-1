<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SCR Water Control Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-Way Type</li><li>3-Way Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SCR Water Control Valves come in two main types - 2-Way and 3-Way valves. The 2-Way type is designed to regulate the flow of water in a straight line, allowing it to either fully open or fully close. On the other hand, the 3-Way type diverts the flow of water in different directions, making it ideal for applications where water needs to be switched between multiple sources. Both types play a crucial role in controlling water flow in various industrial and residential settings.</p></p>
