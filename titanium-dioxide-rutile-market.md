<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Titanium Dioxide Rutile Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulphate Process</li><li>Chlorination Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Titanium Dioxide Rutile is produced through two main processes: Sulphate Process and Chlorination Process. The Sulphate Process involves treating ilmenite ore with sulfuric acid, resulting in a fine powder with excellent whiteness and brightness. On the other hand, the Chlorination Process involves using chlorine to react with titanium ore, producing a pure titanium tetrachloride which is then oxidized to form rutile. Both processes have their unique advantages and are utilized in different markets based on their specific properties and applications.</p></p>
