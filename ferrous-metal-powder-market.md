<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ferrous Metal Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Compaction</li><li>Hot Compaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ferrous metal powder market can be divided into two main types: cold compaction and hot compaction. Cold compaction involves pressing the metal powder at room temperature, resulting in lower density and less strength compared to hot compaction. On the other hand, hot compaction involves heating the metal powder before pressing, leading to higher density and better mechanical properties. Both methods have their own advantages and applications in various industries such as automotive, aerospace, and electronics.</p></p>
