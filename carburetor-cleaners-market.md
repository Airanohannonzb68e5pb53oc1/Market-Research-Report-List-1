<p><p>Carburetor cleaners can be categorized into two main types: chlorinated and non-chlorinated. Chlorinated cleaners contain chemicals like methylene chloride, which are very effective at breaking down carbon deposits and grime. However, they are also more harmful to the environment and can be toxic if inhaled.
