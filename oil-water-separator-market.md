<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-water Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity OWS</li><li>Centrifugal OWS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil-water separators come in two main types: Gravity OWS and Centrifugal OWS. Gravity OWS use the difference in density between oil and water to separate them, allowing oil to rise to the top and water to settle at the bottom. Centrifugal OWS utilize centrifugal force to separate oil and water, spinning the mixture at high speeds to force the oil to the outer edges for removal. Both types of separators are essential in industries such as manufacturing, automotive, and wastewater treatment to efficiently remove oil contaminants from water.</p></p>
