<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floor-standing 3D Printer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FDM（FusedDepositionModel）</li><li>SLA（Stereolithography）</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Floor-standing 3D printers come in various types, with two popular ones being FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) and SLA (Stereolithography). FDM printers use a filament that is heated and extruded onto a build plate layer by layer to create the final object. On the other hand, SLA printers use a liquid resin that is hardened by UV light to create the object. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different industries based on their specific requirements.</p></p>
